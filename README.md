# Human-Activity-Recognition_DeepLearning

## Project Description
Human Action Recognition (HAR) aims to understand human behavior and assign a label to each action. It has a wide range of applications.
## About the dataset
- The dataset features 15 different classes of Human Activities.
- The dataset contains about 12k+ labeled images including the validation images.
- Each image has only one human activity category and is saved in separate folders of the labeled classes
